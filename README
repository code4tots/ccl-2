Sanity (CCL - Cackle)
=====================

Simple programming language with an object model a lot like Lua's.

Usage: ./run.sh <path_to_ccl_script>


Goals
-----

  * Easy to implement and port to new platforms. This is accomplished by:
    * using a very easy to parse syntax.
    * very simple and flexible object model.
    * pushing a lot of functionality into core libraries written in CCL.

  * Easy desktop gui for
    * making simple games
    * making simple utilities
    * designing a text editor

  * Easy mobile gui (android/iOS) for
    * making simple games really quick
    * making simple apps and bodges

  * Eventually, make the implementation fast enough for contests.
