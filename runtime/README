So far I've been pretty haphazard about indicating what should be standard with respect to what debugging/stacktrace abilities need to be available etc.

This is an attempt to solidify this.

Stack traces will no longer show lines, but like Java, just indicate what file you're in and what line number you're in.

Portability will be facilitated by a simpler intermediate language.

The intermediate language will still be 'higher level' than bytecode like Java.
