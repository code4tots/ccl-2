Roadmap -- List of features I'm thinking of adding
==================================================

WIP
---

* Desktop GUI API
* Desktop GUI API with OpenGL
* Android API
* iOS API (probably using some translation tool like Google's j2objc)

Done features
-------------

* Separate syntax for calling methods as opposed to retrieving attributes.
  * I'm considering leaving '.' for methods and using '@' for attributes.
