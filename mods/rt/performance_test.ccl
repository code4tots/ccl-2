This is compared to an older version:

Kyumins-MacBook-Pro:ccl math4tots$ git checkout 7d1575e9e4168dc7dc902fda2d3aa17ccb8ae73e
Kyumins-MacBook-Pro:ccl math4tots$ xccl mods/performance_test.ccl 
total = 499999500000
elapsed time ~ 0.403 sec
total = 4.999995E11
elapsed time ~ 0.419 sec

-----

So not that much worse.
I did expect some more overhead.

But also, in the older version, there was a separation between float and int.

Now they are all just 'Number'.
