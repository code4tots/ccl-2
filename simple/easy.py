"""easy.py

simple.py was too hard...

Maybe I'll come back to that template idea at some point.

But I'm afraid of working too far without a clear design and knowing
what's on the other side. It's too scarry.

------

Instead easy.py is going to basically do what 'go' does.
The translation to Java should be basically 1-1.

I will have to do a second pass after the parse to annotate which
classes implement which interfaces, but that is pretty simple.
